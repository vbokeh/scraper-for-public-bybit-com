# TODO

- [ ] Create Makefile to init/clean venv
- [ ] Add a command to recursively unzip the fetched data

## Nice to have
- [ ] Try using `requests.Session()` to see if the process is more efficient with it.
- [ ] Investigate asyncio and request concurrency (may complexify the whole thing with handling both data discovery and queuing download, but can be a good exercise).
